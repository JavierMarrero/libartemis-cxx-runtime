/**
 * Defines a comparator function-like object that takes two arguments and
 * returns the result of comparing two objects. Comparison may be performed
 * based on arbitrary constraints.
 * <p>
 * The specified comparator must return values so that when comparing to zero
 * all the operators express their meaning in a correct way: they must be
 * semantically consistent.
 * <p>
 * For example, the most common return values are -1, 0 and 1. This means the
 * following:
 * <pre>
 * Given two objects, A and B, if A > B will return 1,<br/>
 * A == B will return 0 and A &lt B must return -1.
 * </pre>
 * <p>
 * This class has the () operator overloaded as specified for functional
 * interfaces.
