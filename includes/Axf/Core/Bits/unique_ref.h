/**
 * A <b>unique reference</b> is a type of smart pointer that only allows single
 * ownership of a particular reference. The object owned by a
 * <code>unique_ref</code> object has a life cycle never exceeding that of
 * this pointerÂ´s.
 * <p>
 * The semantics of this reference is determined by the quality that this
 * reference owns and manages another object, disposing of it when it goes out
 * of scope.
 * <p>
 * The object is deleted using a deleter functor object when either of the
 * following happens:
 * <ul>
 *  <li>the managing <code>unique_ref</code> is deleted.</li>
 *  <li>the managing <code>unique_ref</code> is assigned to another reference</li>
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * The pointer is deleted using a <i>(possibly user-supplied)</i> deleter to
 * automatically release memory.
 * <p>
 * This class is not <b>copy assignable</b> nor <b>copy constructible</b>.
