# Artemis: A C++ Framework for Portable Application's Programming

Artemis is a C++98 framework that aims to provide services similar to those provided by the Java Class Library and other high-level programming languages. These services are,
at some extent, part of the newest C++ standards; but, as compiler support for those C++ standards is not always present, Artemis presents a highly portable, highly standard
compliant implementation of many commons services used by several types of applications.

Artemis presents the user a set of interfaces and classes that may be used to fulfill the following needs:

- Multithreading
- Synchronization
- I/O
- Logging
- Runtime Type Information (a.k.a reflection)
- Type traits
- Automatic reference counting (RAII memory management)
